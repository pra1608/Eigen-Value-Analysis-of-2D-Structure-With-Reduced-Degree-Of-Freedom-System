# Eigen-Value-Analysis-of-2D-Structure-With-Reduced-Degree-Of-Freedom-System
Seven Octave files are included in this project:
1. project1.m, % File for Reduction in the size of substructure1
2. project2.m, % File for Reduction in the size of substructure2
3. project3.m, % File for Reduction in the size of substructure3
4. project4.m, % File for Reduction in the size of substructure4
5. comb.m,     % File for assembly of all reduced substructures
6. Fulldof.m   % File for assembly of full sized substructures
7. Finalrun.m  % File to run all 6 files above to get the final output
So, only running the Finalrun.m in octave will provide the required outputs.
2DStructure.txt will be build after running the Finalrun.m which contains all the necessary results
that are represented in the project report.
All the octave files are required to be in the same folder for successful run.
